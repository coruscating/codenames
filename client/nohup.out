Problem! This project does not have a .meteor/release file. The file should
either contain the release of Meteor that you want to use, or the word 'none'
if you will only use the project with unreleased checkouts of Meteor. Please
edit the .meteor/release file in the project and change it to a valid Meteor
release or 'none'.
