A chip on your shoulder
A dime a dozen
A drop in the bucket
A fly on the wall
A fool and his money are easily parted
All bark and no bite
All greek to me
A piece of cake
A slap on the wrist
A taste of your own medicine
A wolf in sheep's clothing
Back to the drawing board
Beating around the bush
Bend over backwards
Between a rock and a hard place
Bite off more than you can chew
Bite your tongue
Bouncing off the walls
Break a leg
Bull in a china store
Can't keep a good dog down
Carry a tune
Caught red-handed
Cold feet
Cost an arm and a leg
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut to the chase
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Drive me up the wall
Everything but the kitchen sink
Feeling under the weather
Finger lickin' good
Frog in your throat
Go for broke
Go out on a limb
Grab the bull by the horns
Green with envy
Gut feeling
Hat trick
Have a cow
Head over heels in love
Hit the nail on the head
Hit the road
Hold your horses
In the bag
In the same boat
Jump the gun
Keep your chin up
Kick the bucket
Knee jerk reaction
Knock on wood
Let bygones be bygones
Loose cannon
Make a mountain out of a molehill
Method to my madness
Never bite the hand that feeds you
Off on the wrong foot
Once in a blue moon
One leg in the door
One smart cookie
On the fence
On the same page
Out of this world
Over my dead body
Over the top
Pedal to the metal
Piece of cake
Pipe down
Practice makes perfect
Pulling your leg
Pull the wool over your eyes
Put your foot in your mouth
Raining cats and dogs
Rule of thumb
Scared stiff
Sick as a dog
Smell something fishy
Spitting image
Start from scratch
Steal my thunder
Take a hike
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
The whole nine yards
Throw a fit
Tie the knot
Tongue-in-cheek
Two left feet
Up a creek without a paddle
Wake up on the wrong side of the bed
Water under the bridge
Wear your heart on your sleeve
When in rome
When pigs fly
Why the long face?
X marks the spot
You are what you eat
You can't judge a book by its cover
